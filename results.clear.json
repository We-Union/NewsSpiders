The Court's decision partially overruled its 1896 decision Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that the "separate but equal" notion was unconstitutional for American public schools and educational facilities.[note 1] It paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement,[3] and a model for many future impact litigation cases.[4]", "time": ["December 9, 1952", "December 8, 1953", "May 17, 1954", "1954", "1951", "1952", "1955", "1955", "1979", "1987", "1989", "1992", "1992", "1999", "1896", "1899", "1908"], "place": ["Topeka", "Kentucky"], "joiner": [{"type": "PERSON", "content": "Brown"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Topeka"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Plessy"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Warren"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "the United States"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Southern"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Ferguson"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "American"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Virginia"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Rehnquist"}]}

With artists like Gustave Courbet capitalizing on the mundane, ugly or sordid, realism was motivated by the renewed interest in the common man and the rise of leftist politics.[2] The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.", "time": [], "place": [], "joiner": [{"type": "GPE", "content": "Italy"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Italian"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Greek"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "French"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Gustave Courbet"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "European"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Émile Zola"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Realist"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "France"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Dutch"}]}

The most significant war was fought with the Seleucid Empire, while the war with Macedonia was the second, and both of these wars effectively marked the end of these empires as major world powers, even though neither of them led immediately to overt Roman domination.[1] Four separate wars were fought against the weaker power, Macedonia, due to its geographic proximity to Rome, though the last two of these wars were against haphazard insurrections rather than powerful armies.[2] Roman influence gradually dissolved Macedonian independence and digested it into what was becoming a leading empire.

The First Iconoclasm, as it is sometimes called, occurred between about 726 and 787, while the Second Iconoclasm occurred between 814 and 842.[1] According to the traditional view, Byzantine Iconoclasm was started by a ban on religious images promulgated by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian, and continued under his successors.[2] It was accompanied by widespread destruction of religious images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images. The Papacy remained firmly in support of the use of religious images throughout the period, and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the Byzantine and Carolingian traditions in what was still a unified European Church, as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of Byzantine political control over parts of the Italian Peninsula.", "time": [], "place": [], "joiner": [{"type": "NORP", "content": "Byzantine"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Leo"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Leo III"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Constantinople"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Constantine"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Islamic"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Germanos"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "Christian"}, {"type": "PERSON", "content": "Christ"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Rome"}]}

Modern ships have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years before corrosion, metal fatigue and a lack of parts render them uneconomical to operate.[1] Ship-breaking allows the materials from the ship, especially steel, to be recycled and made into new products. This lowers the demand for mined iron ore and reduces energy use in the steelmaking process. Fixtures and other equipment on board the vessels can also be reused. While ship-breaking is sustainable, there are concerns about the use by poorer countries without stringent environmental legislation. It is also labour-intensive, and considered one of the world's most dangerous industries.[2]", "time": [], "place": ["Bangladesh"], "joiner": [{"type": "GPE", "content": "India"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Bangladesh"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Alang"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "European"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Kaohsiung"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "China"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Pakistan"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "Taiwan"}, {"type": "NORP", "content": "South Asian"}, {"type": "GPE", "content": "the United States"}]}

Some common themes found in new media art include databases, political and social activism, Afrofuturism, feminism, and identity, a ubiquitous theme found throughout is the incorporation of new technology into the work. The emphasis on medium is a defining feature of much contemporary art and many art schools and major universities now offer majors in "New Genres" or "New Media" and a growing number of graduate programs have emerged internationally.[1] New media art may involve degrees of interaction between artwork and observer or between the artist and the public, as is the case in performance art. Yet, as several theorists and curators have noted, such forms of interaction, social exchange, participation, and transformation do not distinguish new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels in other strands of contemporary art practice.[2] Such insights emphasize the forms of cultural practice that arise concurrently with emerging technological platforms, and question the focus on technological media per se.

Friedländer's acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy. Beginning in the 1490s, as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, Renaissance ideals and painting styles were incorporated into northern painting.
